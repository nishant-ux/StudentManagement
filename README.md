# Student Record Management System (Java)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is my solution for **Task 2: Student Record Management System** given in the Java Developer Internship.  
It is a **console-based CRUD system** to manage student records.

---

## âœ… What I Have Done
- Created a **Student class** with fields (ID, Name, Marks).  
- Implemented **encapsulation** using private fields with getters and setters.  
- Used **ArrayList** to store multiple Student objects dynamically.  
- Developed a **menu-driven system** for Add, View, Update, Delete, Exit.  
- Added **exception handling (try-catch)** for invalid inputs.  
- Added **input validation** (marks must be between 0â€“100, correct menu choices, etc.).  
- Displayed **clear error messages** for invalid or missing records.  
- Wrote a **README.md** to explain project structure and usage.
